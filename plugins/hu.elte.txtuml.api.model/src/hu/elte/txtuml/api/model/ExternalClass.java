package hu.elte.txtuml.api.model;

/**
 * Base class for external classes in the model. External classes are those
 * which's implementation is not part of the model, and from the scope of the
 * model they function as black boxes. They might be used to bring external
 * features into the model or to communicate with components of the program that
 * are not part of the model.
 * <p>
 * By the current implementation, external classes <b>are not exported</b> to
 * EMF-UML2, with the exception of standard library classes
 * {@link hu.elte.txtuml.stdlib.Timer Timer} and
 * {@link hu.elte.txtuml.stdlib.Timer.Handle Timer.Handle}. The planned design
 * is to include all external classes in the model with an 'external' stereotype
 * and empty operations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Represents:</b> external class
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * From outside the model, use external classes according to the rules and
 * conventions of the Java language. The only restriction is that an external
 * class may not be abstract because that could cause problems during model
 * execution or exportation. From inside the model, use them as any passive
 * model class (that is, one that may not react to any asynchronous events).
 * Call its methods as operations or use its fields as attributes. All its
 * fields used from inside the model must be of a type extending
 * {@link ModelValue}. Also all parameter and return types of methods called
 * from inside the model must extend <code>ModelValue</code>.
 * <p>
 * As the txtUML API uses its own thread for model execution, external classes
 * probably need synchronization.
 * <p>
 * When a method of an external class is called from the model (on the model's
 * executor thread), it can call back to methods of model classes, get or set
 * fields before it returns. However, if it is called from a different thread,
 * it may only communicate with the model through signals or by creating new
 * model objects, as it might be done from anywhere outside the model. For
 * details about managing the model from outside, see the documentation of
 * {@link Model}.
 * <p>
 * In case of primitive values, this class has specific protected methods to
 * convert <code>ModelType</code> objects back to their raw value (the primitive
 * values represented by them). These methods may only be used to convert data
 * gained from the model for an external component. If any data is sent back to
 * the model, it must be in the form of <code>ModelType</code> objects.
 *
