/**
 * An external class which enhances the txtUML models with the ability of using
 * timed events.
 * <p>
 * By calling the {@link Timer#start(ModelClass, Signal, ModelInt) start}
 * method, a new delayed send operation can be started, which means that a
 * signal will be asynchronously sent to the a target model object after a
 * specified timeout.
 * <p>
 * When using timers, calling {@link Timer#shutdown} to shut down the model
 * executor is recommended instead of {@link ModelExecutor#shutdown} or
 * {@link ModelExecutor#shutdownNow} as those two methods do not take timed
 * events into consideration.
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> starting timers after the model executor is shut down will
 * result in errors.
 * <p>
 * See the documentation of {@link hu.elte.txtuml.api.Model} for an overview on
 * modeling in txtUML.
