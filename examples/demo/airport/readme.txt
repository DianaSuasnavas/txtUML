Dear User!

This project (demo/airport) is a still work in progress demo project 
for txtUML tool. We wanted to share it because it uses a lot of 
features of the tool and also uses the model to run a GUI with 
a Glue layer.
Other then this is a big project and a good proof of the tool 
working it still needs to evolve as not every feature is 
presented on the GUI. Therefore there may be "TODO" lines 
scattered in the project. We will keep working on this demo.

Regards,
  txtUML team
