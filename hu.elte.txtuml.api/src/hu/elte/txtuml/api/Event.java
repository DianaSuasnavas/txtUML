/**
 * Base class for events in the model.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Represents:</b> event
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * As <code>Event</code> is just a base class for events, it is not used
 * directly to define certain kinds of events.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Java restrictions:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>Instantiate:</i> disallowed</li>
 * <li><i>Define subtype:</i> disallowed, inherit from its predefined
 * subclasses, like {@link Signal}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> the only event type currently implemented in txtUML is a signal
 * event, which is represented by referencing its signal directly.
 * <p>
 * 
 * See the documentation of {@link Model} for an overview on modeling in txtUML.
