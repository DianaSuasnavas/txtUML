/**
 * Abstract base class for association ends in the model.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Represents:</b> association end
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage:</b>
 * <p>
 * 
 * Association ends should be defined as nested classes of an association (a
 * subclass of {@link Association}).
 * <p>
 * When asked for the model objects at an association end (with the
 * <code>assoc</code> method of {@link ModelClass}), an instance of the actual
 * representing class of that certain association end will be returned. As all
 * association ends are implementing the {@link Collection} interface, the
 * contained objects might be accessed through the collection methods.
 * <p>
 * 
 * TODO upgrade doc: checking multiplicity when???
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Java restrictions:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>Instantiate:</i> disallowed</li>
 * <li><i>Define subtype:</i> disallowed, inherit from its predefined subclasses
 * instead (see the nested classes of {@link Association})</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * See the documentation of {@link Association} for details on defining and
 * using associations.
 * 
 * See the documentation of the {@link hu.elte.txtuml.api} package to get an
 * overview on modeling in txtUML.
